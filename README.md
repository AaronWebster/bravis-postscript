% Periodic and Aperiodic Lattices in $R^2$

Once upon a time I did some research into aperiodic crystals in the context
of photonic bandgaps.  I ended up needing some figures, and thought it fun
to write them directly in PostScript.

Here are the are five regular lattice types in $R^2$, known as 
[Bravis lattices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravais_lattice).  They are

* Oblique
* Rectangular
* Rhomb
* Square
* Triangular

Additionally, I provide the
[Fibonacci](http://www.cmth.ph.ic.ac.uk/people/a.mackinnon/Lectures/cp3/node81.html)
and the random lattice.
